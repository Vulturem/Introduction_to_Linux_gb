NAME
       SED - STREAM EDITOR FOR FILTERING AND TRANSFORMING TEXT
SYNOPSIS
       SED [OPTION]... {SCRIPT-ONLY-IF-NO-OTHER-SCRIPT} [INPUT-FILE]...
DESCRIPTION
       SED  IS A STREAM EDITOR.  A STREAM EDITOR IS USED TO PERFORM BASIC TEXT TRANSFORMATIONS ON
       AN INPUT STREAM (A FILE OR INPUT FROM A PIPELINE).  WHILE IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO AN  EDI‐
       TOR  WHICH PERMITS SCRIPTED EDITS (SUCH AS ED), SED WORKS BY MAKING ONLY ONE PASS OVER THE
       INPUT(S), AND IS CONSEQUENTLY MORE EFFICIENT.  BUT IT IS SED'S ABILITY TO FILTER TEXT IN A
       PIPELINE WHICH PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHES IT FROM OTHER TYPES OF EDITORS.
       -N, --QUIET, --SILENT
              SUPPRESS AUTOMATIC PRINTING OF PATTERN SPACE
       --DEBUG
              ANNOTATE PROGRAM EXECUTION

       -I[SUFFIX], --IN-PLACE[=SUFFIX]
              EDIT FILES IN PLACE (MAKES BACKUP IF SUFFIX SUPPLIED)
       -L N, --LINE-LENGTH=N
              SPECIFY THE DESIRED LINE-WRAP LENGTH FOR THE `L' COMMAND
       --POSIX
              DISABLE ALL GNU EXTENSIONS.
       -E, -R, --REGEXP-EXTENDED

       -S, --SEPARATE
              CONSIDER FILES AS SEPARATE RATHER THAN AS A SINGLE, CONTINUOUS LONG STREAM.
       --SANDBOX
              OPERATE IN SANDBOX MODE (DISABLE E/R/W COMMANDS).
       -U, --UNBUFFERED
              LOAD MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM THE INPUT FILES AND FLUSH THE OUTPUT BUFFERS MORE
              OFTEN
       -Z, --NULL-DATA
              SEPARATE LINES BY NUL CHARACTERS
       --HELP
              DISPLAY THIS HELP AND EXIT
       --VERSION
              OUTPUT VERSION INFORMATION AND EXIT
       IF NO -E, --EXPRESSION, -F, OR --FILE OPTION IS GIVEN, THEN THE FIRST NON-OPTION  ARGUMENT
       IS  TAKEN  AS  THE  SED  SCRIPT  TO INTERPRET.  ALL REMAINING ARGUMENTS ARE NAMES OF INPUT
       FILES; IF NO INPUT FILES ARE SPECIFIED, THEN THE STANDARD INPUT IS READ.

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
       THIS  IS JUST A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF SED COMMANDS TO SERVE AS A REMINDER TO THOSE WHO ALREADY
       KNOW SED; OTHER DOCUMENTATION (SUCH AS THE TEXINFO DOCUMENT) MUST BE CONSULTED FOR  FULLER
       DESCRIPTIONS.
   ZERO-ADDRESS ``COMMANDS''
       : LABEL
              LABEL FOR B AND T COMMANDS.
       #COMMENT
              THE COMMENT EXTENDS UNTIL THE NEXT NEWLINE (OR THE END OF A -E SCRIPT FRAGMENT).
       }      THE CLOSING BRACKET OF A { } BLOCK.
   ZERO- OR ONE- ADDRESS COMMANDS
       =      PRINT THE CURRENT LINE NUMBER.
       A \
       TEXT   APPEND TEXT, WHICH HAS EACH EMBEDDED NEWLINE PRECEDED BY A BACKSLASH.
       I \
       TEXT   INSERT TEXT, WHICH HAS EACH EMBEDDED NEWLINE PRECEDED BY A BACKSLASH.
       Q [EXIT-CODE]
              IMMEDIATELY  QUIT  THE SED SCRIPT WITHOUT PROCESSING ANY MORE INPUT, EXCEPT THAT IF
              AUTO-PRINT IS NOT DISABLED THE CURRENT PATTERN SPACE WILL  BE  PRINTED.   THE  EXIT
              CODE ARGUMENT IS A GNU EXTENSION.
       Q [EXIT-CODE]
              IMMEDIATELY  QUIT  THE SED SCRIPT WITHOUT PROCESSING ANY MORE INPUT.  THIS IS A GNU
              EXTENSION.
       R FILENAME
              APPEND TEXT READ FROM FILENAME.
       R FILENAME
              APPEND A LINE READ FROM FILENAME.  EACH INVOCATION OF THE COMMAND READS A LINE FROM
              THE FILE.  THIS IS A GNU EXTENSION.
   COMMANDS WHICH ACCEPT ADDRESS RANGES
       {      BEGIN A BLOCK OF COMMANDS (END WITH A }).
       B LABEL
              BRANCH TO LABEL; IF LABEL IS OMITTED, BRANCH TO END OF SCRIPT.
       C \
       TEXT   REPLACE THE SELECTED LINES WITH TEXT, WHICH HAS EACH EMBEDDED NEWLINE PRECEDED BY A
              BACKSLASH.
       D      DELETE PATTERN SPACE.  START NEXT CYCLE.
       D      IF PATTERN SPACE CONTAINS NO NEWLINE, START A NORMAL NEW CYCLE AS IF THE D  COMMAND
              WAS  ISSUED.   OTHERWISE, DELETE TEXT IN THE PATTERN SPACE UP TO THE FIRST NEWLINE,
              AND RESTART CYCLE WITH THE RESULTANT PATTERN SPACE, WITHOUT READING A NEW  LINE  OF
              INPUT.
       H H    COPY/APPEND PATTERN SPACE TO HOLD SPACE.
       G G    COPY/APPEND HOLD SPACE TO PATTERN SPACE.
       L      LIST OUT THE CURRENT LINE IN A ``VISUALLY UNAMBIGUOUS'' FORM.
       L WIDTH
              LIST  OUT THE CURRENT LINE IN A ``VISUALLY UNAMBIGUOUS'' FORM, BREAKING IT AT WIDTH
              CHARACTERS.  THIS IS A GNU EXTENSION.
       N N    READ/APPEND THE NEXT LINE OF INPUT INTO THE PATTERN SPACE.
       P      PRINT THE CURRENT PATTERN SPACE.
       P      PRINT UP TO THE FIRST EMBEDDED NEWLINE OF THE CURRENT PATTERN SPACE.
       S/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/
              ATTEMPT TO MATCH REGEXP AGAINST THE PATTERN SPACE.   IF  SUCCESSFUL,  REPLACE  THAT
              PORTION  MATCHED WITH REPLACEMENT.  THE REPLACEMENT MAY CONTAIN THE SPECIAL CHARAC‐
              TER & TO REFER TO THAT PORTION OF THE PATTERN SPACE WHICH MATCHED, AND THE  SPECIAL
              ESCAPES \1 THROUGH \9 TO REFER TO THE CORRESPONDING MATCHING SUB-EXPRESSIONS IN THE
              REGEXP.
       T LABEL
              IF A S/// HAS DONE A SUCCESSFUL SUBSTITUTION SINCE THE LAST INPUT LINE WAS READ AND
              SINCE THE LAST T OR T COMMAND, THEN BRANCH TO LABEL; IF LABEL IS OMITTED, BRANCH TO
              END OF SCRIPT.
       T LABEL
              IF NO S/// HAS DONE A SUCCESSFUL SUBSTITUTION SINCE THE LAST INPUT  LINE  WAS  READ
              AND  SINCE  THE  LAST  T  OR  T COMMAND, THEN BRANCH TO LABEL; IF LABEL IS OMITTED,
              BRANCH TO END OF SCRIPT.  THIS IS A GNU EXTENSION.
       W FILENAME
              WRITE THE CURRENT PATTERN SPACE TO FILENAME.
       W FILENAME
              WRITE THE FIRST LINE OF THE CURRENT PATTERN SPACE TO FILENAME.  THIS IS A  GNU  EX‐
              TENSION.
       X      EXCHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE HOLD AND PATTERN SPACES.
       Y/SOURCE/DEST/
              TRANSLITERATE  THE  CHARACTERS  IN  THE PATTERN SPACE WHICH APPEAR IN SOURCE TO THE
              CORRESPONDING CHARACTER IN DEST.
ADDRESSES
       SED COMMANDS CAN BE GIVEN WITH NO ADDRESSES, IN WHICH CASE THE COMMAND  WILL  BE  EXECUTED
       FOR ALL INPUT LINES; WITH ONE ADDRESS, IN WHICH CASE THE COMMAND WILL ONLY BE EXECUTED FOR
       INPUT LINES WHICH MATCH THAT ADDRESS; OR WITH TWO ADDRESSES, IN  WHICH  CASE  THE  COMMAND
       WILL  BE  EXECUTED  FOR  ALL INPUT LINES WHICH MATCH THE INCLUSIVE RANGE OF LINES STARTING
       FROM THE FIRST ADDRESS AND CONTINUING TO THE SECOND ADDRESS.  THREE THINGS TO  NOTE  ABOUT
       ADDRESS  RANGES: THE SYNTAX IS ADDR1,ADDR2 (I.E., THE ADDRESSES ARE SEPARATED BY A COMMA);
       THE LINE WHICH ADDR1 MATCHED WILL ALWAYS BE ACCEPTED, EVEN IF  ADDR2  SELECTS  AN  EARLIER
       LINE; AND IF ADDR2 IS A REGEXP, IT WILL NOT BE TESTED AGAINST THE LINE THAT ADDR1 MATCHED.
       AFTER  THE ADDRESS (OR ADDRESS-RANGE), AND BEFORE THE COMMAND, A !  MAY BE INSERTED, WHICH
       SPECIFIES THAT THE COMMAND SHALL ONLY BE EXECUTED IF THE ADDRESS (OR  ADDRESS-RANGE)  DOES
       NOT MATCH.
       THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS TYPES ARE SUPPORTED:
       NUMBER MATCH  ONLY  THE SPECIFIED LINE NUMBER (WHICH INCREMENTS CUMULATIVELY ACROSS FILES,
              UNLESS THE -S OPTION IS SPECIFIED ON THE COMMAND LINE).
       FIRST~STEP
              MATCH EVERY STEP'TH LINE STARTING WITH LINE FIRST.  FOR EXAMPLE,  ``SED  -N  1~2P''
              WILL PRINT ALL THE ODD-NUMBERED LINES IN THE INPUT STREAM, AND THE ADDRESS 2~5 WILL
              MATCH EVERY FIFTH LINE, STARTING WITH THE SECOND.  FIRST CAN BE ZERO; IN THIS CASE,
              SED OPERATES AS IF IT WERE EQUAL TO STEP.  (THIS IS AN EXTENSION.)
       $      MATCH THE LAST LINE.
       /REGEXP/
              MATCH  LINES  MATCHING THE REGULAR EXPRESSION REGEXP.  MATCHING IS PERFORMED ON THE
              CURRENT PATTERN SPACE, WHICH CAN BE MODIFIED WITH COMMANDS SUCH AS ``S///''.
       \CREGEXPC
              MATCH LINES MATCHING THE REGULAR EXPRESSION REGEXP.  THE C MAY BE ANY CHARACTER.
       GNU SED ALSO SUPPORTS SOME SPECIAL 2-ADDRESS FORMS:
       0,ADDR2
              START OUT IN "MATCHED FIRST ADDRESS" STATE, UNTIL ADDR2 IS FOUND.  THIS IS  SIMILAR
              TO  1,ADDR2,  EXCEPT THAT IF ADDR2 MATCHES THE VERY FIRST LINE OF INPUT THE 0,ADDR2
              FORM WILL BE AT THE END OF ITS RANGE, WHEREAS THE 1,ADDR2 FORM WILL STILL BE AT THE
              BEGINNING OF ITS RANGE.  THIS WORKS ONLY WHEN ADDR2 IS A REGULAR EXPRESSION.
       ADDR1,+N
              WILL MATCH ADDR1 AND THE N LINES FOLLOWING ADDR1.
       ADDR1,~N
              WILL MATCH ADDR1 AND THE LINES FOLLOWING ADDR1 UNTIL THE NEXT LINE WHOSE INPUT LINE
              NUMBER IS A MULTIPLE OF N.
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       POSIX.2 BRES SHOULD BE SUPPORTED, BUT THEY AREN'T COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF PERFORMANCE  PROB‐
       LEMS.   THE  \N  SEQUENCE IN A REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHES THE NEWLINE CHARACTER, AND SIMI‐
       LARLY FOR \A, \T, AND OTHER SEQUENCES.  THE -E OPTION SWITCHES TO USING  EXTENDED  REGULAR
       EXPRESSIONS  INSTEAD;  IT  HAS BEEN SUPPORTED FOR YEARS BY GNU SED, AND IS NOW INCLUDED IN
       POSIX.
